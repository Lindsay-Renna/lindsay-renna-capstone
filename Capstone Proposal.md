# Project Title

Famtivity

## Overview

FamTivity is an innovative web application designed to help families plan custom family nights based on their preferences, the number of children, and their ages. This project aims to bring families closer by providing tailored activity suggestions that cater to the unique dynamics of each family.

### Problem

Parents often find it challenging to come up with new and engaging activities for their family nights. The time required to research, plan, and organize these activities can be a significant barrier.
Families tend to recycle the same few activities, which can lead to boredom and a lack of enthusiasm for family time. There's a need for a diverse range of activities that cater to different interests and age groups.Traditional methods of planning family activities do not provide interactive elements such as ratings, feedback, and community sharing, which can enhance the overall experience and engagement.

### User Profile

- Families with children of various ages seeking to enhance their quality time together.
- Parents looking for easy and convenient ways to plan engaging activities.
- Caregivers and educators interested in structured yet fun family activities.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.
